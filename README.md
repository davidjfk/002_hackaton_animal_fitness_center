# The goal of the hackathon

To have you use all of your current HTML/CSS knowledge to create a website you're proud of.

<br/>
<br/>

## Basic requirements

Sure, here is the numbered list inside a markdown file:

1. Use a clear subject for your website: "My website is about...".

2. Create multiple pages.

3. Use at least 5 different HTML elements.

4. Use semantic HTML elements in the right places.

5. Put CSS in a separate stylesheet (do not use inline CSS (= CSS inside of an HTML file))

6. Do not use CSS frameworks.

7. Use margin, padding, or border in at least 2 different places on your website. (a.k.a: prove that you know how the box-model works)

8. Use at least 1 image.

9. Use at least 2 links.

10. Use media queries, making your website look different on mobile and desktop.

11. Use CSS-grid to create a layout and position all elements on a page. (Only required if you've been taught about CSS-grid during the course)

12. Use flexbox to position elements (Only required if you've been taught about flexbox during the course)

13. Create at least 1 form.

14. Your website should be mobile-first. Your base CSS should be for mobile devices. Use media queries to make your website look nice on desktop. Don't forget the mobile view meta-tag (see note below).

15. We will pay attention to the cleanliness of your code:

   a. Pay attention to any spelling errors (use a linter).

   b. Make sure your code is formatted correctly. Use spaces and enters properly.

<br/>

Note: Don't forget to add the following HTML meta-tag to the <head> element in index.html:  

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">  

This will make sure your website is viewed with the proper scale on mobile.  
Without this tag, some mobile devices will use a different resolution.  
When this happens, the mobile screen may end up showing CSS that was intended for desktop views.
